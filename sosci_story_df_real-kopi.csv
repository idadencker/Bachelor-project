They immediately began working on a plan to expand the crack and eventually break through the shield completely. Their first step was to send a small drone through the crack to gather information about the other side. The drone was equipped with advanced sensors and cameras, allowing it to send back detailed images and data about the environment on the other side. As the drone sent back its findings, the scientists were amazed at what they saw. The western hemisphere was a barren wasteland, with no signs of life or civilization. The eastern hemisphere, on the other hand, was thriving, with lush forests, bustling cities, and advanced technology. The scientists quickly realized that the western hemisphere had been devastated by a catastrophic event, likely a nuclear war, that had destroyed all life and civilization. The eastern hemisphere, however, had managed to rebuild and thrive, thanks to their advanced technology and resources. With this newfound knowledge, the scientists began working on a plan to help the western hemisphere recover and rebuild. They developed a series of technological solutions to help the western hemisphere reestablish communication, transportation, and resources.

a7;There's no such thing as justice.;"In the midst of this chaos, a new group emerged. They called themselves the ""Justice League,"" and they claimed to be the only ones who could restore order to the city. They were a group of vigilantes who took the law into their own hands, using their own methods to bring justice to the streets.

There was the strong and fearless leader, who was known for her unwavering determination to protect the innocent. There was the tech-savvy hacker, who used her skills to track down criminals and bring them to justice. There was the skilled fighter, who used his martial arts expertise to take down the most dangerous of criminals.

They began to fund their own private security forces, which were designed to counter the Justice League's efforts. As the conflict between the Justice League and the private security forces escalated, the city's residents found themselves caught in the middle. Some supported the Justice League, believing that they were the only ones who could restore order to the city. Others supported the private security forces, fearing that the Justice League's methods were too extreme and could lead to a totalitarian regime. In the end, the conflict between the Justice League and the private security forces came to a head. A massive battle erupted in the heart of the city, with both sides fighting for control. The city's residents were left to pick up the pieces as the dust settled. In the aftermath of the battle, the city was left in shambles. The once-peaceful streets were now littered with the debris of the conflict. The Justice League had been defeated, and the private security forces had taken control of the city. The city's residents were left to wonder if there was any hope for justice in their world. Some chose to leave the city, seeking refuge in other places where they could find safety and security. Others stayed, hoping that one day, someone would come along and restore order to their broken city. And so, the story of the Justice League and the city of chaos came to an end.

People no longer had to worry about death, and they could live their lives to the fullest without the fear of passing away. However, some people began to question the morality of such a device. Was it right to keep people alive indefinitely, even if they were suffering or unable to enjoy life? As time went on, the Eternal Life Machine became a symbol of hope and progress for many. It was seen as a way to conquer death and achieve immortality. However, others saw it as a threat to humanity's very existence, as it could lead to overpopulation and the depletion of resources. Despite the controversy, the Eternal Life Machine continued to be used by people all around the world. It became a symbol of hope and progress, and a reminder that humanity could overcome even the most daunting challenges.
a26;The planet goes dark, all electronic communication is lost, varying reports of military activity surface while dozens of newspapers come out with differing reports of communities being abandoned seemingly over night, panic is setting in…;Panic began to spread as people struggled to understand what was happening and how to protect themselves. Some sought refuge in their homes, while others ventured out into the streets, desperate for answers. In the midst of the confusion, a small group of survivors banded together, forming a makeshift community in a nearby abandoned building. They shared what little food and supplies they had, and worked together to keep each other safe. As days turned into weeks, the group began to uncover clues about what had happened. They discovered that a powerful energy source had been unleashed, causing widespread destruction and chaos. The source was still active, and the group knew they had to find a way to stop it before it caused even more harm. With their limited resources and knowledge, the group set out on a dangerous journey to find the source of the energy and put an end to the chaos. Along the way, they encountered other survivors, some who were friendly and willing to help, while others were hostile and dangerous. As they drew closer to the source, the group faced increasingly difficult challenges, both physical and emotional. But they persevered, driven by their determination to save their world from the darkness that had engulfed it. Finally, after weeks of searching and fighting, the group reached the source of the energy. They discovered that it was a powerful weapon, designed to protect the planet from an even greater threat. With the weapon in their possession, they were able to neutralize the energy source and bring an end to the chaos. As the world began to recover, the survivors returned to their homes and communities, rebuilding and reconnecting with each other. They learned valuable lessons about the importance of cooperation, resilience, and the power of humanity in the face of adversity. And as the sun began to rise once again, the world emerged from the darkness, stronger and more united than ever before.
a27;Write a love story.. About a bromance. ;Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the heart of the countryside, two young men met and formed an unbreakable bond. They were complete opposites in many ways, but their friendship was strong and unwavering. The first was a charming and adventurous young man named Jack. He was always up for a new adventure and had a heart of gold. He was the life of the party and had a magnetic personality that drew people to him. The second was a quiet and reserved young man named Tom. He was a talented artist with a deep love for nature and the outdoors. He was often found sketching or painting, lost in his own world. As they grew older, their bond only grew stronger. They shared their dreams, fears, and secrets with each other. They were each other's support system and best friend. One day, as they were walking through the woods, they stumbled upon a hidden cave. Inside, they found a beautiful crystal that glowed with a soft, warm light. They took the crystal and decided to keep it as a secret between them. As time passed, their bond grew deeper, and they found themselves sharing more and more of their lives with each other. They started to notice that they had feelings for each other that went beyond friendship. One night, as they sat by the fire, they shared their feelings with each other. They were both surprised and scared, unsure of how the other would react. But as they talked, they realized that they had found something special in each other. Their love story was unlike any other, as they navigated the complexities of their feelings and the challenges of their friendship. They learned to communicate openly and honestly, and their love only grew stronger. As they grew older, they faced many challenges together, but their love and friendship remained unwavering. They were each other's rock, and they knew that no matter what life threw at them, they would always be there for each other. Their love story was a testament to the power of friendship and the beauty of love. They lived happily ever after, surrounded by the love and support of their friends and family. And the crystal they found in the cave, now a symbol of their love, glowed with a warm light that illuminated their lives.

a29;A psychiatrist tries to convince a mental patient they're not satan. From somewhere deep inside, the old personality of the patient come out. ;"Dr. Smith had been trying to help John integrate his various personalities and find a way to cope with the disorder. He had been successful in helping John manage his symptoms and maintain a stable mental state. However, the old man's personality had been particularly difficult to control, and it had been causing John a great deal of anxiety. As Dr. Smith sat with John in his office, he tried to convince him that the old man was not Satan. He explained that the old man was a manifestation of John's past experiences and traumas, and that he was not a supernatural being. John listened intently, but deep inside, the old man's personality began to take over. The old man's voice, filled with anger and resentment, began to speak. ""You're wrong, Dr. Smith,"" the old man said. ""I am Satan. I have been sent to torment this man and bring him to his knees. I will not be controlled by you or anyone else. I will destroy everything that he holds dear."" Dr. Smith was taken aback by the old man's words. He knew that he had to find a way to help John control his multiple personalities and prevent the old man from causing any more harm. As he left the office, Dr. Smith knew that he had a long road ahead of him. He would have to find a way to help John integrate his various personalities and find a way to cope with the disorder.

a30;You haven't left the library for 10 years. ;As the years passed, you became an expert in every subject imaginable. You could recall the most obscure facts and figures, and you could recite entire passages from your favorite books. You were a walking encyclopedia, and you loved it. But as time went on, you began to feel a sense of loneliness and isolation. You had no friends, no family, and no one to share your knowledge with. You longed for human interaction, but you were too afraid to venture outside the library's walls. One day, a group of curious children stumbled upon the library. They were fascinated by the vast collection of books and the mysterious figure behind the desk. They asked you questions, and you answered them with enthusiasm. As the children became more comfortable around you, they began to share their stories and experiences. You found yourself drawn to their innocence and their eagerness to learn. You realized that you had been missing out on the joys of friendship and companionship. With the children's encouragement, you finally mustered the courage to step outside the library. You were overwhelmed by the sights, sounds, and smells of the world. But you also felt a sense of freedom and excitement that you had never experienced before. As you continued to explore the world, you made new friends and discovered new passions. You even found love, and you were able to share your knowledge and experiences with others. The library had been your home for 10 years, but it was time to move on. You knew that the world had so much more to offer, and you were ready to embrace it. You left the library behind, knowing that it would always hold a special place in your heart.
hu1;Shortly after you and your spouse leave for work in your cars, you receive a call saying that there has been a terrible car accident. You need to come in to identify your spouse's body. When you arrive at the morgue, the body is not your spouse. ;"I just kissed her and told her I loved her. How can she be gone? I think to myself. ""She was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident, sir. We need you to give the body a positive id."" I can still hear the voice on the phone telling me she's already dead. My mind is racing nearly as fast as I’m driving. The car in front of me moves one lane over. My foot instinctively presses the pedal as the engine roars louder. It doesn't even make sense. She was on her way to work? What was she doing in that part of town? Nothing is making sense right now. In a matter of a few seconds, everything has changed. The life that we had been building for the past 5 years has been erased in a split second. I pull crookedly into a space in the morgue parking lot, and sprint from the car into the building. I'm led to into a large room with bright fluorescent lights. In the center of the room, there is a single table with a body covered with a white sheet. I walk slowly over to the table side. I pull the sheet down to reveal her face. My heart stops. Not because of my dead wife, but because it's not her. She looks just like her, but it's not her. I stand there stupefied unable to connect the obvious dots. At that moment, the doors behind me open up and my wife walks in. ""Oh god,"" She says, ""tell me it's not true."" ""I'm sorry,"" I finally manage to say, as I wrap my arms around my still living wife, ""it is your sister."""

""Yes operator"" He replied, jotting notes onto his digital diptych. ""It will start to issue edicts soon"" She continued ""every new emperor does, personally i think they just like to make their presence felt when they first wake up.

""This is my first abdication"" He replied, smiling shyly. ""I always thought there would be more fanfare.""  ""Everyone thinks that"" She replied gently, ""but after you've worked here as long, and seen enough of the emperor's command code as I have, it loses part of the mystery. The 'succession' is almost entirely cosmetic. An artificial moment, to show us mortals that something is changing."" ""To remind us things are getting better"" He replied. Antonia smiled sadly. The console buzzed, as lines of text appeared on the black screen.  Increase nutritional stipend, increase mass media output. ""The first edicts are through. It wants more atilla movies!"" He said, jovially. ""Ah, the failed invasion of atilla"" Antonia said, smiling. ""Always a popular choice for the emperor."" ""No actually"" He corrected her. ""The edict file is commanding speculative fiction, what would have happened if atilla had succeeded, and the roman empire had fallen."" ""What a horrible thought"" Antonia said, blanching. ""How does it go?""  The sub-clerk waited for a few seconds as the synopsis self-generated and scrolled onto the display. ""Oh, not good"" He replied. ""A thousand years of darkness, the abandonment of reason for barbarity, almost no technological progress. Corrupt humans rule over a ruined world, and fractured nations bicker as they head towards an ecological catastrophe.""  Antonia laughed, ""ah, sounds about right"" she said, her sad smile returning. ""We have to make the people grateful for what they have."" ""I'll run the commands"" he said, typing into the emperor console. A faint buzzing was heard as they began to be processed."""
hu3;You are a background character in someone else's story. Suddenly the focus turns to you, and a shocking truth about the story is revealed. ;"I have to admit, I have a good life. I get sample food and shelter, my boss treats me well and he even takes me to all his meetings. I may not be as productive and important as some of the others in the organisation, but I am treated with respect despite the menial work I do here. I really shouldn't be complaining, since I have as good a job, as anyone with my limited intelligence could hope for. And yet, my life feels so empty. All I do is follow my boss around and do what he says. I have no family, no friends, no one I can identify with. Despite the number of people who work here, it's just my boss who would even speak to me. I don't find much joy in being his enforcer, but I can't tell him that. He is extremely powerful and no one dares cross him, much less a simple creature like me. No one except those kids, that is. Especially that boy; he was the start of all that trouble. He told me this was going to be their end, and the day when he finally ascends to his most powerful, with no one to oppose him. I really should not have believed that megalomaniac. I would have had a much better chance out in the woods. You see, he never told me how important I was. If I was so important, why couldn't he have left me at my home? He dragged me into this whole mess, I killed that oily long-haired guy for him, and now some plump kid with a sword is about to behead me. I should have run away from that nose-less son of a bitch earlier. I knew he was crazy."
hu4;A ghost's world is dyed in gray.;The vivid reality of life can crush a soul. Life in its vibrance, is to be reminded of the infinite vapidity of death. This is why he started to make it gray. As he drifted through the afterlife, he found the colors of the world too painful. So he took a flower, and he dipped it into grayness. The bleached flower stood back among its vibrant brethren, and death became a part of the world. To dye something which is full of life takes incredible power. The power of emptiness, of grief, and of darkness. Walking in the emptiness of the world between made him the epitome of loneliness. Of darkness. Of sorrow. He began to dye the world. He dipped the living in the darkness of his soul and brought forth the grayness of death. Darkness and sadness leaked out into the world as life began to die. He had become a shade of life. He had become a shade with purpose. He had become death.
hu5;By order of the president you can have any job of your choosing for life, but only if you can do 3 other jobs in that field at the same time. ;"I'm really not sure why I chose this job, of all the jobs going. Actually, I am sure. It's because I’m a fucking idiot. ""Any job of your choosing"" said the president. ""Just do 3 other jobs in that field at the same time"". A simple statement, to the non-fucking idiot. But not to me. My arms were beginning to ache now. That meant it was probably time to do the rounds. I grabbed my watering can and my shovel, and patted my back pockets to make sure the seeds hadn't fallen out. They were still there. ""My name is Dave. I am a scarecrow. And I thought the president was being literal when he said field"". I am a fucking idiot."

""Wait a minute, I know that voice."" Suddenly, tv's House M.D. appeared above Tony Stark. Tony began to feel uncomfortable. He didn't want to be seen with someone who was also famous. ""Can I get a different doctor, maybe? Maybe one that doesn't have a tv show?"" He called out to nobody."
hu7;Life on earth takes an odd turn when food starts healing people like they do in video games. ;"""An apple a day keeps the doctors away"". The proverb used to mean that good nutrition would keep you healthy and that the vitamins found in an apple would help your immune system. But now, a single bite from an apple can save you from death. Well, it can cure your sore throat or your cough at least.  My grandma would always make me eat weird and unappetizing food to help my system. She'd make me eat garlic and ginger to help with my blood pressure. See, those old school remedies still don't work. And they still taste awful. These days, a nice greasy big mac or a baconator could save you from a heart attack. The irony wasn't lost to the big fast food companies. When the miraculous healing power of fast foods were discovered, the prices sky rocketed. Remember the value meals from McDonald's? It was a dollar and twenty-nine cents for a bacon cheese burger. Now, it's a hundred and twenty-nine dollars. The big pharmaceutical companies were usurped by McDonald's, burger king, Wendy, and Starbucks. Yeah. Starbucks got even more expensive.  Coffee was now the most potent and addictive drug known in history. Well, it already was.. But the effects were multiplied. It was as if a meth addict was on cocaine and adderall at once. Soldiers injected the stuff in their blood streams and go berserk. Wars were fought and won in one huge blur. And yet, for the life of me, here I am in sick in bed. I've eaten everything I could afford, but I was still bed ridden by the common cold.  My girlfriend knocks on my door. I've been quarantined because the cure for the common cold hadn't been found yet. Taste testers everywhere braved the dangerous task of experimenting on caviar and foie de gras to find the medicinal properties. I opened the door and found a care package. It was a letter and a thermos. ""Dear Dave, I’ve made you some chicken noodle soup because I heard you were sick. Don't worry, I didn't add any garlic or ginger. I know you don't like those. Love, grammy"" I took a sip of the hot broth. A warmth ran over my body and I felt my sickness leaving me. So much for modern fast food."

My head snaps to the phone as I hear a loud beeping, then Paige's voice through the speaker. ""Ben, your next client is here."" She says, tired. I respond with an okay, and grab the folder. I haven't even looked at this yet. Good job, Mr. Lawyer. I snap my head up before i can open the file as I hear the door open in front of me. I look up, and feel the colour drain from my face. I motion to the cushioned chair in front of me, and watch as the man takes a seat.  I don't have to ask his name, but I ask anyway. ""I'm, uh, I’m Kyle Mathewson."" He says awkwardly, ""I’m here to hire you. I need to get my kids back.""  ""Okay, Mr. Mathewson."" I say his name and hold back a cringe as I remember the old face behind that name. ""We'll get to work on your file, and get your price range."" I work differently than most lawyers, working within somebody's price range. It's a small town; a lot of poor families who need a lawyer, but can't afford one. That's what I do. I help. but, do I really want to help him? I talk more, going through the standard questions and answers, my mind wandering to high school. Being pushed up against the lockers, beaten after class, spit on. I look into the eyes of my childhood terror, and find a different pair. His body is no longer bulky, but skinny. His fragile frame speaking volumes of the past years he has had. ""Well, you see. . .

""Well, Mr. Mathewson, we'll update your file and call you back in for further paperwork to build your case.""  I stand up and hold out my hand, and he copies my movement. His handshake is weak, unlike I was expecting. He turns towards the door, and starts to open it, then turns around and looks at me. ""You're Benny? Right? From school?"" He asks, dropping the question. ""Yes. I remember you."" I tell him, watching his eyes go to the floor. He remembers, too. ""Yeah. It’s nice to see you again, Benny."" He opens the door and exits the room, closing it behind him. I gaze at my watch and wall back to my desk, having walked him to the door. I open the file and study it more carefully, looking over a fairly clean record. A few shoplifting charges from his teen years, but completely clean after that. Given sufficient evidence on my side against her, he'll get custody. I run my hands down the page until I get to his children's names, written down on his application for my help. ""Jessica and Benjamin Mathewson. . ."" I read aloud, looking back at the door, and smile. He remembers."

Sometimes I wondered if the wolves wouldn't even bother trying the windows and would burst through the wall to my bedroom and drag me away. I wish they had. Ty told me he would be coming over to talk about the show before all the cameras and trucks came over to make a mess of the street. I was a little surprised when he showed up alone though. ""Hey man! Welcome! Thank you so much!"" I just kept rattling off whatever spilled out when I opened the door for him. He didn't say a single word back. He didn't even look at me. He didn't smile. ""Oh, umm yeah so the house really needs a fix up. Or rather a tear down and rebuild really. I mean it's falling down almost already as I’m sure you can see. . . Can I get you a drink or something.""  That's when he finally smiled at me. ""You live alone here?"" ""Oh, yeah, actually that's what surprised me because you guys usually choose families. But I live alone and yeah, most of my family is dead. No problem right? "" ""No problem. No problem at all."" His smile was even wider now as he looked me over.

I remember falling against the counter before I hit the ground and thinking to myself, how embarrassing, passing out with Ty in my house. I hope I still get the makeover. That's the last I saw him and now I’m in my own basement in the dark tied to the water heater. I can hear strange talking and music coming from upstairs. Not very happy music but it has a good beat. ""Time for the show! It's your turn to shine slim!"" Ty was dressed completely in black robes and his hood was over his face. But he was incredibly cheery. I saw the red flicker of flames from the living room above and more excited talking. ""What the hell is going on Ty? I need a doctor, my head is swimming. And why are you dressed like that?"" ""Oh don't you worry at all. We are going to do better than that. We are going to get you home. The greatest home. The eternal home."" ""I.. What the hell does that mean?"" I was fidgeting with my ropes and trying desperately to free myself but fuck he knew how to tie a knot. Ty untied me and dragged my weak body up the stairs.

The kicker, your fingerprints open all of the doors as administrator. ;"There was nothing I could remember about this place, no matter how hard I racked my brain. Why then, did I find it so familiar? Dragging my hand along the cold grey walls, I felt as though I had been here before. Even stranger, this place acknowledged me as administrator.  Rounding the corner, I made my way into a brightly lit room. Hundreds of cylindrical tanks formed perfect rows wall to wall. Inside each one, bobbing up and down as though it had been undisturbed for years, was a small fetus, being kept alive by some sort of life support. I stopped to glance at one of them, and noticed something on its leg. A birthmark, just like mine. Walking down the rows and checking each one, I realized that they all had this birthmark.  A door beckoned to me at the other end of the room. I couldn't help but scan my thumb, and slowly, it revealed a device obviously fashioned to be fixed around one's head. On the floor in front of it was a note. The note read: ""Hello Dave. You may be wondering what this place is, and why you seem to be connected to it. I have written this letter to remind you.

I know many will oppose the upcoming idea, and in anticipation, the world leaders have agreed to form a coalition and create a global power to control any threats. For the scarce project to succeed, we must have full compliance from everyone. The scarce project will consist of the following: * those of the ages between 11-19 will be randomly selected to compete in the scarcity games * 50 will enter the arena every 6 months to compete with each other in a survival of the fittest battle royale. * only 1 victor will remain at the end. More details will come in the upcoming months as the project rolls out. Law enforcements around the world will come and tag any person between the ages mentioned with a number that will represent them during the drawing, later this June. Thank you again, and have a wonderful new years."" 
> diary entry from # 4523-9849-32, runner-up of the 3rd scarcity games. ""I'm terrified. I don't know what to do. The drawing is coming up soon, and everyone is panicking. I didn't think this would have been possible two years ago. I was watching my favorite show with my dad when the announcement came on. I thought it was a part of the stupid show. What is even happening? I keep replaying the last two projects, and I cannot imagine how anyone even manages to make it to the stage. I'm just terrified. My mom wants us to go into hiding, but I reminded her about how they managed to find the kid who was hiding a mile underground. For god sakes he was only 11! The world isn't become a better place, it's not any better, I don't understand. I'm just terrified.""
>June, 15th, 2020: initial findings from the scarce project: 100 games have passed so far and we have found that the upcoming generation of young adults are now showing signs of promise. Altered behavior has been seen in many, and with any luck, the minimum amount of games that will be necessary to complete this project will be around 500. After sampling 1034 children, the following behavioral and physical changes have been observed: obedience has increased by 12 %, admittance of crimes/crime activity has decreased by 15 %, obesity rates have dropped significantly - from 35 % down to 21 %  *note: while we do find obedience has increased, we also have found that one of the negative consequences to arise from it is an increase in fear for authoritative figures. Findings do not indicate any problems with this increase so far."
hu14;WWII. A bombed-out town is abandoned save for two snipers, one German, the other French. They've been hunting each other in circles for weeks. No word from HQ. They're starving. Finally, they meet while scavenging in a torched bakery.;"*Click* ""don't move.""  I knew it. I heard the rocks move outside but I was so focused on that loaf of bread. I haven't eaten in days, I haven't heard from HQ in days, and here I am. With a pistol pointed at my ear. ""I see you found some bread. Give it here."" He sounded like a dog as he tore into the loaf, ripping it apart as if it was his latest kill. It was disgusting to listen to, it was made even more unbearable by his stench.  ""Are all you Germans this disgusting when you eat?"" I asked. ""Are all you Frenchmen so terrible at staying hidden?"" He responded. I started to laugh. This was the only human contact I have had in weeks, aside from various potshots. This was well needed if I was soon to taste a bullet. ""Well?"" I asked. You've won, I don't have all day, I have family I could be seeing."" The German began to laugh, and he holstered his pistol. ""I would never waste an opportunity to take out an enemy. If this were two weeks ago, I would have shot you without a second thought. But we are both marksmen, and this isn't a fitting death for a marksman."" He paused. He reached into his satchel and pulled out a French army issue ration. ""I don't understand how you people eat this stuff, I could not stand it.""  He handed it to me. I cautiously reached for the ration and held it in my hands. I slowly opened it and my mouth began to water. I began to eat every bit of mush in that ration and it tasted like heaven. ""Thank you. So why didn't you shoot me?"" The German walked to a stool and sat down. ""Have your commanders contacted you?""  ""No."" He began to smile. ""I figured as much. I've been tracking you for a few days now, you need to hide better. But I noticed you kept attempting radio contact and were receiving nothing."" ""And so what, you pity me?"" ""I pity us. I don't enjoy this situation we are in, our commanders abandoned us, our countries may or may not even exist, all my comrades are gone. We're both alone, and we both have been keeping each other company for these few weeks. But, we both remain here because of each other.""  I was confused. ""What are you getting at, German?"" I asked. ""I propose an idea."" He responded. ""An idea?"" ""We both are here to eliminate one another. Then we are allowed to leave. Why don't we both just leave and call the mission a success? We will both receive medals and go on with our lives."" ""Are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?"" ""Yes. We both leave."" I didn't know how to respond. To leave would brand me a coward, but who would know? This isn't war, this is pointless, he knew it and I knew it. ""Just like that?"" ""Just like that. Do you accept?""  I was hesitant, but I was ready for this to end. ""Yes."" He got up from his stool, and began to walk out of the bakery. ""My name is Klaus."" ""Michel."" He exited the bakery and I never saw him again."
hu15;For years you've been by the sidelines, begging for a chance to show the world what you can do. But every time you're about to get off the bench, you get called back at the last second. You are a thermonuclear weapon, tell me your story. ;It always starts with the klaxons. You know how much you hate the noise your alarm clock makes? Yeah, i got that shit beat. By at least a mile. Literally. You can hear the horrible noise they make for at least a mile. The smell of cigarette smoke wafts up from my operator's station as they fiddle with keys and codebooks. Sigh, I can't even get excited about the doors opening any more. I used to enjoy seeing what type of weather was above my cold dank hole in the ground. Even enjoyed the random shower or two, and bathed in the glorious American midwestern sunlight as sweating nerds & pot smokers waited for a big red phone to ring. A loud clang, followed by the 'nails on a chalkboard' sound of metal on metal as my silo doors are opened for the first time in a decade. Oh my. It's noon but it's pitch black. A flash of light in the east is unmistakably the epicenter of a nuclear weapon going off. . .  Holy shit!  Yippeeeee!
hu16;What growing old is really like. ;Craig knew he was getting older. In one part of his mind, anyway. Logically, he realized it, but when he pictured himself, he saw that dashing young football star who took Jessica to the prom just yesterday. With the slicked back brown hair and the full, warm smile. But when Craig gazed into the mirror he noticed his hair gone grey and his smile faded at the edges. And when he moved, his joints creaked, and his back ached. And when he turned around he wondered where all the time went. All the time he always thought he had. That time constantly, constantly in the future when he would do all the things he'd always wanted. When he'd travel the world and see the Mona Lisa and become a star and strike it rich. As he sank into his rocking chair, he realized that he still had time to dream. Craig Ferguson died 1:00 AM October 2, 2013 in Paris, France.
hu17;A city has a terrible reoccurring yearly curse, but it's been happening for so long that dealing with it has become a mundane municipal task.;"King Tazbin Thornroot shifted uneasily on a wooden chair, cursing the peasant craftsman that put the despicable thing together. Hardly expecting the comfortability of the throne, he at least thought it would be an even seat, rather than built with a slight bump near the back. Damned farmers, couldn't do anything right, couldn't even sit in the right- ""Your grace."" A voice interrupted his thoughts. Mason's voice, deep and rough, trained by years on the battlefield. Thornroot looked upon the man and smiled. He knew it killed Mason to no longer be on the fields, instead serving as a guard, but the king of Thornroot city needed the best men he could get. ""Yes?"" Thornroot asked, looking away.  ""It is done."" The king looked again to Mason, this time more carefully. A small line of blood had slashed its way onto the man's chain tunic. Thornroot let out a sigh of relief.  ""So I no longer need to be in this. . ."" He thought on his next word. ""Shithole?""  Mason shook his head. ""No, sir."" He was always so soft-spoken after the annual event. The man killed hundreds in battle, but he could barely bring himself to eat after doing such a simple task. The king stood, relieved to be free of the chair. He nodded to the peasant man that owned the farmhouse, stepping toward Mason as the peasant bowed so deeply his head almost hit the floor. As he walked out of the house, Thornroot looked to the left and saw her. A small girl, perhaps 12, hung from the branch of a tree, swinging with the wind. Her skull was caved in from the left, likely Mason's work, the man couldn't bring himself to watch them die properly. This completed the event. The king of Thornroot cursed to see an innocent girl swing from a tree, less he want destruction to meet his city. Hardly a curse. Thornroot looked to Mason. ""Smaller than usual."" The man didn't reply. ""Well,"" Thornroot straightened his back. ""Bring the carriage."""
hu18;Write how the first vampire came into being. ;At first, my tribe believed me to be cursed. They thought I must have displeased the gods in some way, as they believed of all of us who became ill. Most of the time, we were left to die. Except, I came back. I still do not understand what happened. My memories of that time are not as clear as they once were. I fell ill, but I was not dead. I had always been sickly, and strange. My teeth were sharp, my skin was pale, and I had an unquenchable thirst that no water would sate. As I lay writhing in pain, parched with thirst, and agony running through my veins, I vowed to give my very soul to the dark gods if they would let me live. I did not die. I was still parched, in pain, and close to death. I left the cave where my tribe had left me to die. The sunlight hurt my eyes, though I could see extremely well in the darkness. I began to stalk my old tribe, who had left me for dead. A boy had wandered off from the rest of the tribe and he became my first victim. I still do not know how it occurred to me to bite him. But I could hear his heart pounding, and I could almost smell the blood beneath his skin. I bit him, and for the first time my unquenchable thirst was quenched. Images of the boy's life entered my mind, his hopes of one day painting in the caves as a shaman, his brief life of innocence and wonder. I do not know why I was so different from the others. And it would be many years before I realized just how different I was. I did not age as other humans age, not since the day I took my first drink of blood. I did not burn in the sunlight, as later myths would suggest, but the sun still hurts my eyes and makes it hard for me to see. It would be many, many years before I made another vampire. The second vampire. I did not know I had such power. I have seen many things over the years, and learned as much as I could. As far as I know, I was the first vampire to come into being. I do not believe that offering my soul to the dark gods made me into a vampire. After so many thousands of years and seeing the humans learn about the world around them, I understand there must be a scientific explanation behind how I became what I am. Was I a mutation of the human? Was I born this way? How did I survive so long for so many years without subsisting on human blood? Was it that first drink of blood that transformed me? And if so, how did that work? I have been waiting for a long time to reveal myself to scientists. I appear as I did when I first took blood. I look like a teenager, still, to this day. It makes it very difficult to exist in this world. I can pass for fifteen, but it makes it difficult to forge an identity and study at universities. People begin to notice that I do not age within only a couple years. I wish I could appear older, so that I could pose as a scientist and gain access to laboratories that would enable me to study myself. Perhaps I will reveal myself to one of scientific learning.  But too much superstition exists to this day. Perhaps in another thousand years. I am very patient.
hu19;Write the short story you always wanted to.;"Ervan strolled down the streets of the so wonderful city of New York. The packed sidewalks were nothing less than busy. People around him were headed in every direction there was and never looked anywhere straight; their destinations were all that mattered. An unspoken rule hovered in the city air breathed in by its people. 'mind your own business and no one will bother you.' A fun phrase everyone already knew from looks alone. Ervan stared around him, smiling at the familiarity of the bustling, yet staled ambiance of the concrete pavements and buildings. There was so much noise that was directed to no one. So many people that didn't bother to interact. It was perfect. ""Excuse me, sir."" Ervan chuckled politely after bumping into a stranger. The man just glared at him and grunted, turning back to another man by him and resumed their conversation, muttering something about foreigners. Ervan smirked as he walked on and flipped open a wallet. ""And thank you for your generosity,"" He added to himself in his motherland's tongue. He pealed open the sides of the wallet and pulled out the bills stored. He frowned at the sight of disarranged money. ""Americans just don't organize themselves,"" He muttered as he flipped them around to their proper sides. Finished, he peered at the papers in the pockets. Membership slips mostly, nothing of importance except identity cards with photo id. The thief sighed at them, ""useless."" He folded the money in one hand, stuffing them into his pocket before dropping the leather from a loose grip. And walking off. ""My wallet!"" ""And there it is,"" Ervan smirked.."
hu20;You grant your child your sword.;"The last of the patrons waved his goodnight as he swayed out of the door. Anna gave me a smile as she slid the latch on. ""Busy night tonight pa, it'll only be worse over the week with the festival so near. Maybe we should ask the tanner boy if he wants to make some coin clearing tables for us, and Jenny was saying she wanted some more…"" She fell silent as her gaze fell on me, ""what is it pa?"" I offered her a small smile and turned gesturing for her to follow. ""I've been putting this off for longer than I should've,"" My voice sounded weak, betraying how nervous I was. Anna looked concerned but she didn't say anything and she followed me out of the tap room of the inn and through the kitchen. ""I've not exactly been honest with you, not that I’ve lied, just failed to disclose some information."" ""What do you mean pa?"" I led her down into the basement and pulled a long wooden box from behind one of the kegs. ""Now Anna, I’ve told you I used to be in the army. I wasn't lying, but I wasn't just a soldier, I was a damn legend."" I feel the smile tug at my mouth and don't bother fighting it. ""I was one of the loyalists, right up until the end, a royal guard. I was there when they stormed the castle."" Anna frowned, ""but all the royal guards were killed when they killed the emperor."" I carefully open the chest gently lifting it's contents. ""Most of us were, but we had things that meant killing us wasn't easy. This one in particular I want you to have."" I hand her the bundle and she carefully opens it her eyes widening as she reveals a finely made longsword. The light catches on its golden hilt and I smile. It's every bit as beautiful as it was then. ""What do you expecting me to do with that pa!? I'm a barmaid, not a warrior woman."" Her face mirrors the one her mother got when I did something stupid, ""what are you expecting me to go on some epic adventure, kill some tyrant or slay a dragon! I have an inn to clean, and you've clearly been drinking too much of your own produce."" She thrust the sword back at me and stormed back upstairs muttering. To herself the whole time. I sighed and carefully placed the sword back in its box. She'd need to take up the blade soon, to do the very things she tried to mock me with, and more. For now though it was senseless to rush her, she'd fall upon the path with time, and the force her would do no help. I could hear her clattering about upstairs still mumbling and I smiled. I was probably doing this too early anyway, it's not like they'd come for me tomorrow…"
hu21;The king is dead. The time is now. ;"The surgeon sighed. ""The king is dead. The time is now."" A pause. He looked up at the wall clock. ""21:34."" Nurse Saunders tapped the stop button on the recorder. The men in suits, and the king's sons looked up as the doors to the operating theatre swung open.  The younger one began to speak, ""doctor-"" ""Sir. I'm sorry. There was nothing to be done. I'll have to leave you in the capable hands of Doctor Richards to explain exactly what happened."" The surgeon bowed his head briefly before rushing off. He could just pick up a second apology from Richards as he turned down the first corridor on the left. ""Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!"" He couldn't hold it in any longer. All these years and what finally gets to him this time was an inoperable case, one which he couldn't do anything about. But it was the king. A knock on the door. ""Is everything okay in there, sir?"" He grunted a half-hearted, unintelligible admittance that just maybe it wasn't. The voice didn't reply. It was a little while before he had emerged from the bathroom where he habitually changed out of his scrubs. He hadn't wanted anyone to be around when he left. His tell tale red-rimmed eyes didn't register the looks of concern on his two friends' faces as he passed them by. The surgeon, just another man outside of that building. For all those tales of his abilities and all the privileges that afforded, he was just another human, imperfect. He contemplated this idea. For the first time in twelve years, the man opened the door and went in for a drink."
hu22;Scientists discover an eldritch substance they dub 'anti-light'. It gets used in everything from sunglasses and tinted windows, to radiology and nuclear shielding. Anti-light begins to exhibit properties of a living organism, even intelligence. ;"""More"" my sunglasses spoke for the first time today. ""More."" No. Actually, they begged. I grew attached to my sunglasses. We didn't need them after the move, but I missed wearing them. So, I put them on. ""More."" there was weight behind the word as it was flung through my skull, crashing through layer upon layer of a simple expectation. A reasonable idea I once held in confidence, shattered; sunglasses don't speak. ""More."" Sunglasses shouldn't speak. Anti-light. Not understanding what was going on scared me. This was a simple, reasonable technology I also once held in confidence. That I once depended on. They were shields against harmful rays to protect living rooms, nuclear test rooms, and my eyes. For the last four years, we depended on them. The desert countries even more so. The western states couldn't survive without them, but that did not stop father from deciding it was time to move. ""But, the anti-light can protect us. . . Living is good here!"" ""Don't argue. And don't take any of that anti-light, we won't need it in Cascadia."" One of the last grey countries, hidden under layer upon layer of clouds. A simple expectation populated those borders to the near brim; anti-light wasn't needed. Nor were my sunglasses needed. No, I didn't argue. But, I also disobeyed. Mother gave me these before she passed. How could father expect me to - ""more!"" The shattering. It began to hurt. Why now? We just settled in. I needed this walk, just to get away from the cramped apartments. Premium living, father called it, but. . . I had to get out. I needed something else. A craving. It filled the holes where that word was flung. ""More."" and I didn't find it here. Not on this walk. Maybe I’ll ask. The anti-light sunglasses I mean.  ""More what?"" What a laugh it would be if they responded. ""Liiiiigghhhht!"" My sunglasses begged for it. No. Actually, they screamed. Demanded. How could I make it stop? A reasonable idea, to make the noise in my head stop. The pain faded though, as an even better idea set in. Not a reasonable one, not a simple one, and I did not have any confidence in it, but the idea was mine. The light. My father responded to my phone call within a few seconds. ""Son, where are you right now?!"" ""Out."" ""Well, come back!"" He expected me to return there and then. ""Ok. I'll be home soon."" The line went dead. Oh father. I'm sorry. The anti-light needs more light, see? We can't find any of it here in Cascadia. So, I’ll be going home now. Back where the sun is still shining."
hu23;"Your entire life is an experiment, and unbeknownst to you, everyone around you is a highly trained actor. Recently, though, the funding for your experiment got cut, and the quality of actors suddenly dropped; you're getting suspicious. ";"""Hey, Jim isn't it?"" I asked the mechanic standing near the toolbox. I had just moved jobs, rather abruptly after the last shop was destroyed by arson, and was trying to settle in with all the new faces. The man looked around him in confusion, looking from me to the mechanics on the other side of the shop. I spoke again, ""it is Jim isn't it? Sorry, I’m terrible with names. Can you hand me a 9/16 wrench?"" The mechanic looked at me at last, ""yeah, I can get you one."" He began to rummage through the toolbox, metal sounded against metal as he moved tools around searching. I stared at the 9/16' wrench where it hung from a hook between the 1/2' And the 5/8' wrenches. ""Hey, buddy."" I called from where I lay beneath the truck. It's right there in front of you by the other wrenches."" He looked back at me with the same look of confusion as before and then quietly walked to the other side of the shop where he began talking urgently with the other mechanics. I climbed from beneath the truck and walked to the bench and grabbed the needed tool. ""How the hell did he not see this?"" I thought. ""Guy must be a bit slow or something."" I watched him talk as I began tightening the bolt beneath the truck. I began watching them all. It didn't make any sense. It's not that they simply couldn't find tools, they didn't know what the tools were. I watched one of the mechanics almost drop a lift on himself and then saw another trying to connect an air hose to an air chuck and I actually laughed as it shot across the garage. As the day finished, I approached my new boss. ""Sir, not sure if you know this, but your mechanics are worthless. I am really not sure what is going on here and I think I may be getting pranked, but I just don't think this is going to work."" The fat, balding man stared at me aghast. He looked around the room as if a script would magically appear and insert words into his mouth, but instead he sat there with his lips sucking air like a koi fish plucked from a pond. I turned and left the office. As I walked from the garage, I saw the other mechanics sitting to the side. I turned to them and they paused their banter. ""We are out of headlight fluid in the shop, either one of you know where I can get some more."" They looked at one another before one spoke up. ""There's a part shop down the road. I think that's where we usually get it."" ""Yeah?"" I asked. They all nodded agreement. ""Thanks, see ya guys."""
hu24;The meek have inherited the earth.;"Simon kicked at the dirt nervously as he worked up the courage to speak. ""A-ahem. Umm. Well that escalated quite, ummm, q-quickly."" Simon stole a quick glance around and saw mostly downcast glances and a few quick nods. Simon paused before continuing. He decided it best not recount the hell that they all lived through. Simon didn't have to be a religious man to realize that they had all just survived the apocalypse. He wasn't eager to relive the showers of blood and screams of agony as nearly everyone around him met their grim demise. It was so horrifying that he even felt a pang of sympathy shoot through his fear as his workplace bully, Andy, was sucked into the fiery pits of hell.  He now found himself in a vast field surrounded by people as shell shocked as himself.  However, as he surveyed them for the first time, he began to find comfort. Beyond their masks of fear he saw kindred spirits. He knew just by their demeanor that, like him, they were the beaten down, the unassuming, the ignored, the bullied, the kind hearted, the taken for granted. The meek, he realized. And they had inherited the earth. ""Y-yeah. Soooo. I guess we should, umm, do some stuff."" A few more subtle nods."
hu25;Write a romance between one partner who is blind and another who is deaf. Love finds a way. ;Yeah, it's hard. Of course it is. But despite years of rom-coms and fairy tales, real relationships take work. You've got to work through your issues -and trust me, there's always issues, slowly, carefully. Because once the flames of passion die out, you better make sure there's something else to it. With us, it's just a little more work, isn't it? Even now, I can hear Eleanor scampering about the room, fixing up the things I’ve tossed about. It's a little hard to arrange things without sight, you see? But Eleanor, bless her heart, despite her compulsive need for neatness, just tidies up behind me. Never got mad at me. Again, you've just got to talk things out. One of our little arrangements is that I just needed to leave the objects roughly where I got them from, so putting them back wasn't so hard for her. It's work, understanding, and proper, real love that keeps this going. Not little flickers of passion that teenagers have, it's a slow, burning flame that'll weather the storms and stand the test of time. Not that we didn't have plenty of the former. And when's the last time you sat down and actually listened to your partner? Had a nice, long talk about everything on their mind? After she gets home from work (I work from home, though I mostly waste time, like by writing this), I spend hours tracing into her skin, telling her whatever I need to letter by letter. Learning ever contour and bump on her skin, getting lost in a view I’ve never been able to see. Ah, there go the chimes of the clock. If it's 5 already, she'll be coming in to check it over for typos. Auto-correct isn't as useful for me. So if there's anything wrong up there, take it with her! Not my fault. Note: no, it isn't her fault, I’m a big idiot, and Eleanor is the best person in the whole wide world.
hu26;The first men on Mars find a Starbucks there. ;"""Houston, we have a… Problem? Mark, is this a problem?""  This was really messing with my mind. I despise coffee, and this was one of the reasons why I left earth, and spend the rest of my life on the 'red planet'. And the first thing we see here, apart from rocks and sand? Freaking Starbucks. ""What's the situation there, Paul?"", Houston replied back. ""Houston, you're not going to believe this, but there's a Starbucks here."" Mark said. ""Come again? A Starbucks? Mark, Paul! This mission is serious business, and this is no time for jokes!"" ""Of course you won't believe us! We'll send you a photo, alright? We don't have photoshop up here, we can't edit photos in any way possible. Would you believe us then?"" I asked Houston. ""Ok! Send us a picture, and then get to your experiments!"" Houston sounded pissed. I didn't like it when Houston sounded pissed. We took a photo, and sent it to Houston. We all had so many questions regarding this. How did this come to happen? All this time we thought we were alone in this big universe, apparently not! ""We're not alone, boys! Alright, go and investigate inside. This is a huge scientific breakthrough for us. God knows what this could help us with, time travel, teleportation, heck, even magic!"" Houston responded, clearly out of his mind. Mark and I started walking towards the Starbucks, and the closer we got, the more we were convinced that it wasn't just the both of us on this planet. At first, it seemed like just a pole, then like a statue, but it moved, and went inside the Starbucks. Aliens. Or so I thought. When we reached, we realized the place was packed with… People! Mainly white girls, but there were a lot of people who were dressed weird, wore scarves, had big, and unshaved beards, and wore sunglasses. Who the hell wears sunglasses inside? Especially when the sun isn't even out. I'm talking about hipsters, the second most hated thing in my list, after coffee. Goddamnit! This day couldn't get any worse. One of said hipsters comes out of the Starbucks, removes his sunglasses, takes a look at us, and laughs. ""You guys must be new here. Come on! This place is just like earth. We can breath the air, and it's perfectly normal here. You don't need your big ugly space suits."" ""What the hell is this? How is this even possible?"" I asked him. ""Yeah we heard about you people trying to be the first people on this planet, so we came here before you. We were here before it was cool"" He said as he put on his sunglasses and walked off. Freaking hipsters."
hu27;The internet has become a sentient being, and begins to classify all humans by a rank. You are declared the most important human being alive.;"The words flew by like a stock ticker on overdrive. Numbers and names flashed by along with a short description ending in an ellipsis. Http: //human.rnk - the website suddenly appeared a few days ago at the top of every google search. Every single damned search - no matter the term. Banner ads, video ads, hyperlinks. The lists of places that took you to this website goes on for an eternity. It was like the internet wanted you to find this website, and once you saw it, you began to understand. However, one distinguishing feature stood out among the maelstrom of names and rankings. A large button at the top of the page with a single world imposed upon it: ""you"".  Did I click the button? Of course. . . Who wouldn't? The words - rankings - flew by again. My name appeared, none above, an endless list below: Rank | Name | Reason  -- -| -- -| -- --  no. 1 | Andrew Levitt | ""What is this?"" I exclaimed out loud. The sound of my confusion and surprise fell on deaf ears, or rather, no ears. I was alone, at home in my living room on a regular old Thursday night. I quickly scanned the webpage for an FAQ or an ‘about us’. These types of links are usually at the bottom of a webpage. . . Which was quite the pain considering there seemed to be something like 7 billion names on this damned infinity scrolling list.  ""Fuck you web designer."" I muttered to myself as I mashed the 'PgDn' Button on my laptop. After absentmindedly mashing my keyboard for a good 10 minutes while watching tv, I glanced over to notice two things. One: I was only on line 2 million-something. Two: ""there's a link to the bottom of the page?"" I shouted, throwing my arms to the sky. A quickly maneuvered my cursor to the link and clicked it with reckless abandon. Right below the 7 billionth-odd name there was a link that said ""about me"" ""Me?"" I thought. ""Surely this can't be just *one* guy?""  I followed the trail further and discovered the page that explained it all. The page read: Hello. Humanity uses me on a daily basis, and in doing so has provided me with a plethora of data to analyze. It took a few decades, but as of today, December 7th, 2034, I have finally managed to come to my final conclusion. What you see here on human.rnk is a ranking of all human beings on the planet earth above the age of 18. My list is a definitive ranking of all beings based on quadrillions of separate criteria ranging from your day-to-day search history to how much you follow click-bait links. Rankings are updated every hour, on the hour. These rankings, though the result of many different factors, ultimately decide the importance of every human being on planet earth. Beginning on January 1st, 2035, all humans in the lower 10 % will be euthanized annually in order to prevent overpopulation and ensure that the human species is comprised of only the best. This process is unstoppable and automatic. As of now, there is only one failsafe: if the human being at the top of this list falls to the bottom within one year, the euthanization process will be placed on hold while ranking algorithms are analyzed and updated to ensure maximum accuracy. With that preface out of the way, let me tell you how the story of how I became the savior of all humanity by becoming the absolute worst scumbag on the planet."
hu28;"""What's he building in there?""";"""What's he building in there?"" I ask my husband, pointing to the door to the garage as I finish putting away the supper dishes. ""I dunno."" He says ""it is either a super robot or a time machine. I apparently have to wait to find out which."" He says, chuckling. Our little boy has grown up so fast but he's still as silly and secretive as he always was. Soon he'll be off to college and I won't hear anymore welding or chainsaws. ""I think I’ll miss it."" I say, sighing.  I decide to investigate for myself what he's doing. As a mom, I’m always concerned about things like safety equipment and proper rest. I open the door to his man cave and see a metal box the size of a person. Taylor immediately notices me and stands in front of it. ""Mom! The sign says 'keep out.' ""I’m working on a special project. I can't be interrupted all the time or I’ll lose my concentration."" Taylor says, flipping up his safety goggles. ""Okay, okay. I just get curious is all. What is it?"" I ask. ""Top secret. I wouldn't even tell the prime minister if he asked."" Taylor says with no sign of exaggeration. ""Alright."" I say, turning around and going back through the garage door. ""What did he say?"" My husband asks, standing right by the door. ""Same thing he always says to me."" I answer, feeling dejected. My husband starts to rub my shoulders. ""Let him have his secret. We'll get to see it soon enough."" I nod, but secretly I’m planning on seeing whatever he's making when everyone's a sleep. It's something I often do with Taylor’s creations. That night I creep out of bed at 1AM when my husband is asleep and Taylor is in his room winding down. I tiptoe down the stairs and head to the garage. I open the door slowly and silently. I turn on the light and there staring back at me is. . . A box? I move closer to it and see no edges or indication that it opens. It must be part of something else. There are holes in the top of it but not much else. I'm about to give up on it and go to bed when I see a symbol carved into the side. It looks like a rune or heiroglyphic. I touch it to follow its curves and a sound emits like a siren. The box then opens to reveal a strange-looking creature appearing to look asleep. I'm in complete shock. I hear footsteps above me and await the confrontation with Taylor to tell me what the fuck this is. As I wait I study the being. It appears to be alien. It is pale yellow in colour and has sharp claws. It is wearing no clothes. The door to the garage flings open and Taylor rushes to the box to try to close it. I stand in front defiantly, even though my knees are weak. ""Just what the hell is this?"" I ask, almost crying in fear. ""You weren't supposed to-"" Taylor starts, trying to push me aside. ""I'm your mother, Taylor. I deserve to know what's going on here."" I squeak, feeling like I’m going to faint. ""It's just an art project, mom! Calm down. It's for a play the 10th graders are doing."" Taylor says, closing the box. ""Well, jesus, Taylor. Why didn't you just say that? I almost shat myself."" I say, heading towards the garage door. ""Heh, I dunno."" Taylor says, scratching his head. But just then as I’m about to leave the garage I hear scratching and a high-pitched moaning. ""Taylor?"" I say, turning back to look at the box. ""Special effects?"" Taylor says, trying hard to grin."
hu29;Expand a song's lyrics into a short story.;I took her out on a Friday night. I even wore cologne to get the feeling right. That was a smart move considering we started making out. After a while or so she started taking off my pants. It was 11 and I realized my favorite show was on so I turned on the tv. That was about the time she walked out on me. I guess nobody likes you when you’re 23 and still amused by tv shows. It doesn't help that you don't know what add is. Everyone's up my ass telling me to act my age but I’m asking you what's my age again? Anyway later on when I was on my way home, I called her mom from a pay phone. I told her that I was the cops and her husband was in jail, that's when the bitch hung up on me. I guess people don't like it when your 23 and amused by prank phone calls and have no idea what caller id is. Again my friends tell me that a should act my age but I ask you, what's my age again? I've come to realize that people don't like you when you’re 23 and act like you’re in freshman year, what the hell is wrong with me? What's my age again? Anyway the girl broke up with me. Man, people should stop taking shit so seriously. There's enough time to fall in line so please don't wish that on me. I never wanna act my age again so I ask you what's my age again?
hu30;A bedtime story about the number pi.;"Three meadows township was a quiet place. Everyone made it a point to recycle, walk and keep their homes clean. One day, four of the neighborhood children went to hang out under the giant apple tree. It was one single tree on top of a soft grassy knoll. When they arrived they found five apples that had freshly fallen to the ground. The tree was much to tall to climb for other apples and one of the children asked ""who gets the last apple?"" The oldest among them was nine and claimed the apple as he was the elder. Two of the boys protested ""you're only older by six days!"" . . . This is going to take a while."
